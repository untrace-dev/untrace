          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Authorized Users; Accounts.</strong> Customer is
            responsible and liable for all actions and inactions by its
            Authorized Users or by any other person or entity to whom Customer

            or permit to use, deploy, or otherwise benefit from the Seawatts

            Customer represents and warrants that all registration information

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Third-Party Software.</strong> Certain components of
            software included as part of the Services, such as through
            integrations made available by Seawatts, are licensed from third
            parties and are subject to terms and conditions provided by such
            third parties, including open-source or private models, algorithms,
            and systems ("Third-Party Software"). Each component of Third-Party
            Software is licensed under the terms of the license that accompanies
            such Third-Party Software, which may include open-source licenses.
            Nothing in this Agreement limits Company’s rights under, or grants
            Company rights that supersede rights available in, the terms and
            conditions of any applicable license for the Third-Party Software.
            Third-Party Software may be subject to separate license agreements
            or restrictions on use ("Third-Party Restrictions"), and Company
            agrees to comply with all such Third-Party Restrictions. THIRD-PARTY
            SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, NOT SEAWATTS. SEAWATTS DOES
            NOT WARRANT, SUPPORT, OR ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY OF ANY KIND FOR
            THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. Optional Third-Party Services.</strong> Seawatts and
            third parties may make available integrations between the Services
            and third-party products or services, including plugins and related
            services ("Third-Party Services") that Company may elect to use. Any
            use of such Third-Party Services is solely between Company and the
            applicable Third-Party Service provider. Because the Third-Party
            Services rely on the Third-Party Service provider's continued
            operation, Seawatts does not warrant or provide support for
            Third-Party Services. Seawatts is not responsible for any violations
            of Applicable Law by Third-Party Service providers, or for any
            liability arising from Company’s use thereof. Seawatts does not
            guarantee the continued availability of any Third-Party Services (or
            any integration with Third-Party Services or related Service
            features), and if such Third-Party Services or related features are
            discontinued, Company will not be entitled to any refund, credit, or
            other compensation. Depending on Company’s location, certain
            Third-Party Services may not be available.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Intellectual Property and Data.</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Content</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Input and Output.</strong> Certain features of the Services
            enable Authorized Users to provide input (such ads files containing
            a company’s regulatory disclosures and press statements) to the
            Seawatts Platform (“Input”), and receive output generated and
            returned thereby based on such Input (“Output”). Input and Output
            are collectively “Content.” As between the parties and to the extent
            permitted by Applicable Law, Company owns all Input. To the extent
            permitted by Applicable Law and the Third-Party Software, and
            subject to Company’s compliance with this Agreement, Seawatts hereby
            assigns to Company all its right, title and interest in and to
            Output; provided, Seawatts may use Content to provide, improve and
            maintain the Services, including sharing with Third-Party Software
            providers, comply with Applicable Law, and enforce its policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accuracy.</strong> Given the nature of machine learning
            algorithms, use of the Services may in some situations result in
            incorrect Output. Company agrees and acknowledges it should evaluate
            the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for its use case,
            including by using human review of the Output.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Responsibility for User Content.</strong> Company is solely
            responsible for its Input and the consequences of providing it to
            the Services. None of the Input (other than Customer Data) will be
            subject to any obligation of Seawatts, whether of confidentiality,
            attribution, or otherwise, and Seawatts is not liable for any use or
            disclosure of any Input. Seawatts may (but is not obligated to)
            remove or alter any Input at any time for any reason. Except as
            expressly stated herein (including Section 4.B), Seawatts neither
            endorses nor is responsible for any Input.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Customer Data.</strong> Customer owns the Customer Data,
            including all Intellectual Property Rights therein. No ownership
            rights in the Customer Data are transferred to Seawatts by this
            Agreement. Seawatts does not have any rights to the Customer Data
            except for the limited express rights granted in this Agreement.
            Customer hereby grants Seawatts a worldwide, perpetual,
            non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable
            (to Seawatts’s third-party service providers) license to host,
            store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify, create
            derivative works of, and distribute Customer Data, in whole or in
            part, in any media or distribution methods now known or later
            developed, solely during the Term and as necessary for Seawatts to
            provide the Services to Customer and in accordance with the settings
            on Customer’s account and the features of the Services Customer
            elects to utilize.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Seawatts IP.</strong> Seawatts and its licensors own the
            Seawatts Platform, Documentation, and Usage Data, including all
            Intellectual Property Rights therein (the “Seawatts IP”). No
            ownership rights in the Seawatts IP are transferred to Customer by
            this Agreement. Customer does not have any rights in or to the
            Seawatts IP except for the limited express rights granted in this
            Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. Feedback.</strong> If Customer gives Seawatts feedback,
            comments, or suggestions concerning the Services (collectively,
            “Feedback”), Customer hereby assigns to Seawatts all right, title,
            and interest in and to the Feedback, and Seawatts is free to use the
            Feedback without payment, attribution, or restriction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. Usage Data.</strong> Seawatts may collect and analyze
            Usage Data and other information relating to the provision, use, and
            performance of various aspects of the Seawatts Platform and related
            systems and technologies (including information provided by
            third-party analytical tools). Seawatts may use Usage Data for any
            purpose, including to improve the Services and develop new products,
            services, features, and functionality.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Confidentiality.</h4>
          <p>
            Each party as Recipient will take reasonable precautions to protect
            Discloser’s Confidential Information and will not use (except as
            expressly permitted in this Agreement) or divulge to any third party
            any Confidential Information except to those employees and
            representatives of Recipient who have a need to know the
            Confidential Information to enable Recipient to perform its
            obligations under this Agreement. Recipient is responsible and
            liable for its employees’ and representatives’ compliance with this
            Section, as if their actions or inactions were an action or inaction
            of Recipient. The foregoing will not apply with respect to any
            Confidential Information five years after the disclosure thereof
            (or, with respect to trade secrets, for so long as such Confidential
            Information constitutes a trade secret under Applicable Law), or any
            Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed by

          <h4>6. Fees and Payment.</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Fees and Payment.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Customer will pay Seawatts all fees for the use of the Services
            described in an Order in accordance with the terms therein (“Fees”);
            provided, if in any month Customer exceeds the monthly users
            permitted under its Order subscription plan, Customer will pay
            Seawatts all fees associated with Seawatts’s then-current plan
            pricing allowing for such number of monthly users. If in any month
            Customer exceeds the monthly users permitted under any standard
            Seawatts subscription plan, Seawatts may (without limiting any other
            available remedy to Seawatts) restrict Customer’s usage to the
            maximum monthly users (or any greater amount, in Seawatts’s sole
            discretion) permitted under a standard subscription plan. Seawatts
            may change the Fees or applicable charges or institute new charges
            and Fees at the end of the initial Order Term or then-current
            renewal Order Term, upon 30 days’ prior notice to Customer (which
            may be sent by email). If Customer believes that Seawatts has billed
            Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact Seawatts no later than
            30 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in
            which the error or problem appeared, to receive an adjustment or
            credit. All Fees are non-refundable, except as otherwise specified
            in this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seawatts, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Fees;
            provided, any Fee change will become effective after the end of the
            then-current billing cycle. Seawatts will provide Company with
            reasonable prior notice of any such change and allow Company to
            terminate this Agreement or any affected Order before such change
            becomes effective. Company’s continued use of Services after a Fee
            change comes into effect constitutes Company’s agreement to pay the
            modified Fee amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise set out in the applicable Order, Subscription Fees
            and Usage Fees are payable within thirty (30) days following the
            month such Fees are incurred. Unpaid amounts (including due to
            Customer’s failure to maintain up-to-date and accurate billing
            information in connection with its account) are subject to a finance
            charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum
            amount permitted by Applicable Law, whichever is lower, plus all
            expenses of collection, and may result in immediate termination of
            access to the Seawatts Platform. Customer will pay all Fees in U.S.
            Dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Payment Processing.</strong> Seawatts may require payment
            by credit card, debit card, or other payment instruments which are
            processed and billed by Seawatts’s third-party payment processors
            (“Payment Processor”). Customer hereby authorizes Seawatts’s Payment
            Processors to bill Customer’s payment instrument on file with
            Seawatts (or provided by or on behalf of Customer to Seawatts or a
            Payment Processor in connection with any invoice or charge) in
            accordance with each Order. Such billing may include advance payment
            on a periodic basis and ad hoc charges for usage Fees and other
            one-time payments. Seawatts will provide Customer with, or otherwise
            make available to Customer, a receipt for each such charge. If
            Seawatts’s Payment Processor is Stripe Inc. (“Stripe”), the
            processing of credit card charges or credits through Stripe, as
            applicable, relating to use of the Service is subject to the Stripe
            Connected Account Agreement
            (https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal), which includes the
            Stripe Terms of Service (https://stripe.com/legal) (collectively,
            the “Stripe Services Agreement”). Customer hereby agrees to be bound
            by the Stripe Services Agreement, which may be modified by Stripe
            from time to time as set forth therein. Customer agrees to provide
            Seawatts and its Payment Processors with current, accurate, and
            complete information about Customer and Customer’s payment methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Taxes.</strong> Other than federal and state net income
            taxes imposed on Seawatts, Customer will bear all taxes, duties, and
            other governmental charges relating to the Services.
          </p>

          <h4>7. Term and Termination.</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Term.</strong> The term of this Agreement will commence
            on the effective date of the first Order between the parties and
            will continue until terminated in accordance with this Agreement
            (the “Term”). If a term is not specified in an Order, the term of
            such Order will be 1 month. Upon expiration of an Order, the Order
            will automatically renew for a term equivalent to the initial term
            of such Order, unless either party notifies the other in writing of
            its desire to terminate the applicable Order at least 2 business
            days before the expiration of the then-current term.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Termination for Breach or Insolvency.</strong> Either
            party may terminate this Agreement or an Order, effective upon
            written notice to the other party, if the other party materially
            breaches this Agreement or an Order and such breach is incapable of
            cure, or (if such breach capable of cure) the breaching party does
            not cure such breach within 30 days of receiving notice of it.
            Seawatts may terminate or suspend this Agreement or any part of it
            immediately upon written notice to Customer without a cure period if
            Customer breaches Section 3.A or any of the terms of this Agreement
            relating to Seawatts’s Intellectual Property Rights or Seawatts’s
            Confidential Information. Seawatts may terminate this Agreement,
            effective immediately upon written notice, if Customer files, or has
            filed against it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
            or pursuant to any other insolvency law, makes or seeks to make a
            general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or applies for,
            or consents to, the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or custodian
            for a substantial part of its property.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Effect of Termination.</strong> Expiration or termination
            of this Agreement will automatically terminate all active Orders,
            but termination of a single Order will not result in termination of
            this Agreement or any other Orders. Upon the expiration or
            termination of this Agreement or an Order all rights and licenses
            granted by Seawatts to Customer under this Agreement or the
            applicable Order will terminate. Either party’s termination of this
            Agreement is without prejudice to any other remedies it may have at
            law or in equity, and does not relieve either party of breaches
            occurring prior to the effective date of termination. Neither party
            will be liable to the other for damages arising solely as a result
            of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. Post-Termination Obligations.</strong> Upon any
            expiration or termination of this Agreement, Seawatts will make all
            Customer Data then held by Seawatts available to Customer for
            electronic retrieval for a period of 30 days. After such period,
            Seawatts will delete any stored Customer Data. Upon expiration or
            termination of this Agreement for any reason: (1) Seawatts will not
            refund Customer any Fees paid in advance of such expiration or
            termination; and (2) within ten days after such expiration or
            termination, Customer will pay Seawatts all remaining usage Fees
            owed under any terminated Order. The following sections of this
            Agreement will survive any expiration or termination of this
            Agreement: Sections 1 (Definitions), 4 (Intellectual Property and
            Data), 5 (Confidentiality), 6 (Fees and Payment), 7.C (Effect of
            Termination), 7.D (Post-Termination Obligations), 8.D
            (Combinations), 8.E (Disclaimer), 9 (Indemnification), 10
            (Limitations of Liability), 11(Arbitration), and 12 (Miscellaneous).
          </p>

            <strong>C. Customer Warranty.</strong> Customer represents and
            warrants to Seawatts that it: (1) has the rights and consents
            necessary and appropriate to authorize and permit Seawatts to use

            behalf of Customer (including all Input) in accordance with this
            Agreement, and such use by Seawatts of Input will not infringe or
            violate any third-party (including any Authorized User) right,
            including any Intellectual Property Right or privacy right; (2) will
            use the Seawatts Platform in compliance with the Documentation and
            Applicable Law; (3) will provide and maintain accurate, current and
            complete information required to enable Authorized Users to register
            for and use the Seawatts Platform; and (4) unless Company has
            received sufficient prior written authorization, Input does not
            contain any confidential information of any third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. Combinations.</strong> Seawatts will have no obligation
            for any infringement of Intellectual Property Rights relating to
            Customer’s use of the Seawatts Platform to the extent arising out
            of: (1) use of Seawatts Platform in combination with other products
            or services not recommended or provided by Seawatts; (2) designs,
            requirements, or specifications required by or provided by Customer;
            (3) use of the Seawatts Platform in breach of this Agreement or
            outside the scope of the license granted to Customer; (4) Customer’s
            failure to use Seawatts Platform in accordance with the
            Documentation; or (5) any modification of the Seawatts Platform not
            made or authorized in writing by Seawatts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. Disclaimer.</strong> Except for the limited warranties
            described in this Section 8 (Warranties and Disclaimer), Seawatts
            makes no other express or implied warranties with respect to the
            Seawatts Platform, Documentation, Services, or otherwise, and
            specifically disclaims all implied and statutory warranties,
            including the implied warranties of non-infringement of third-party
            rights, merchantability, satisfactory quality, accuracy, title, and
            fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties arising from
            course of dealing, usage, or trade practice. Except for the limited
            warranties described in this Section 8, the Seawatts Platform,
            Documentation, and Services are provided “as is.” Seawatts does not
            warrant that the Seawatts Platform, Documentation, or Services will
            satisfy Customer’s requirements, are without defect or error, or
            that the operation of the Seawatts Platform will be uninterrupted.
            Seawatts makes no warranties of any kind with respect to any Third
            Party Software. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
            limitation of warranties, so that limitation or exclusion may not
            apply to Customer.

          <p>
            <strong>
              F. Seawatts may make features of the Seawatts Platform classified
              as “alpha” or “beta” available to Customer (“Beta Features”).
              Seawatts makes no representations that any Beta Features will be
              made generally available and Seawatts may discontinue or modify
              any Beta Feature without notice. Beta Features are provided “AS
              IS,” and Customer’s use of a Beta Feature is at Customer’s sole
              risk.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h4>9. Indemnification.</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Defense.</strong> At Seawatts’s option and request,
            Customer will defend Seawatts and its officers, directors,
            employees, agents, service providers, licensors, and affiliates
            (collectively, the “Seawatts Indemnified Parties”) from any actual
            or threatened third-party claim, proceeding, suit, action, or
            inquiry arising out of or based on Customer’s breach of Section 3
            (Use Restrictions and Responsibilities) or Section 8 (Warranties and
            Disclaimer) (a “Customer Indemnifiable Claim”). If Seawatts requests
            Customer to defend it from any Customer Indemnifiable Claim,
            Seawatts will: (1) give Customer prompt written notice of the
            Customer Indemnifiable Claim; (2) grant Customer full and complete
            control over the defense and settlement of the Customer
            Indemnifiable Claim; (3) provide assistance in connection with the
            defense and settlement of the Customer Indemnifiable Claim as
            Customer may reasonably request; and (4) comply with any settlement
            or court order made in connection with the Customer Indemnifiable
            Claim. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Customer will not
            enter into any settlement that involves an admission of guilt or
            liability of Seawatts without Seawatts’s prior written consent.
            Seawatts may participate in the defense of a Customer Indemnifiable
            Claim at its own expense and with counsel of its own choosing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Indemnification.</strong> Customer will indemnify the
            Seawatts Indemnified Parties from and pay: (1) all damages, costs,
            fines, judgements, expenses, and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred
            by Seawatts Indemnified Parties in any Customer Indemnifiable
            Claim); and (2) all amounts that Customer agrees to pay to any third
            party to settle any Customer Indemnifiable Claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. IP Infringement.</strong> If the Seawatts Platform is
            held to infringe (or if Seawatts reasonably believes will be held to
            infringe) any third-party Intellectual Property Rights, Seawatts
            may, at its option and expense: (1) modify the Seawatts Platform to
            make it non-infringing; or (2) obtain a license that permits
            Customer to continue using the Seawatts Platform. If Seawatts does
            not believe either option is reasonably practicable, Seawatts may
            terminate this Agreement. This Section 9 states Seawatts’s sole and
            exclusive liability, and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, for
            the actual or alleged infringement of any third-party Intellectual
            Property Rights arising from Customer’s use of the Seawatts
            Platform.
          </p>

          <h4>10. Limitations of Liability.</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Exclusion of Damages.</strong> Seawatts will not be
            liable to Customer for any consequential, incidental, special, or
            exemplary damages arising out of or related to this Agreement,
            including lost profits or loss of business, even if Seawatts is
            apprised of the likelihood of such damages occurring.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Damages Cap.</strong> Seawatts’s total liability of all
            kinds arising out of or related to this Agreement (including
            warranty claims), regardless of the forum and regardless of whether
            any action or claim is based on contract, tort, or otherwise, will
            not exceed the total amount paid by Customer to Seawatts under this
            Agreement during the 12 months immediately proceeding the claim,
            less any liabilities previously incurred by Seawatts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Applicability.</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow
            the exclusion or limitation of damages. This Section 10 (Limitations
            of Liability) will apply to Customer solely to the extent permitted
            by Applicable Law.
          </p>

          <h4>11. Arbitration.</h4>
          <p>
            Any claim, dispute, or controversy between the parties arising out
            of or relating to this Agreement which cannot be satisfactorily
            settled by the parties will be finally and exclusively settled by
            binding arbitration (“Arbitration”) upon the written request of
            either party. The Arbitration will be administered under the
            American Arbitration Association’s Commercial Dispute Resolution
            Procedures in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted (the
            “Rules”). The Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator
            selected in accordance with the Rules. The seat of the Arbitration
            will be in New York, New York. The Arbitration will be conducted in
            English. The Arbitration award will be final and binding upon the
            parties, and judgment upon such award may be entered in any court
            having jurisdiction. The Arbitration proceedings and any award will
            be each party’s Confidential Information. The arbitrator’s award may
            include compensatory damages against either party but the arbitrator
            will not be authorized to and will not award punitive damages
            against either party. The parties agree to keep confidential the
            existence of the arbitration, the arbitral proceedings, the
            submissions made by the parties, and the decisions made by the
            arbitrator, including its awards, except as required by Applicable
            Law and to the extent not already in the public domain. Nothing in
            this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit
            the right of either party to: (A) seek injunctive relief in a court
            of law; or (B) to file suit in a court of law to address an
            intellectual property infringement claim.
          </p>

          <h4>12. Miscellaneous.</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>A. Publicity.</strong> Seawatts may publicly list Customer
            as a customer of Seawatts and use Customer’s trademark, trade name,
            and logo for marketing or promotional purposes and in other
            communications with existing or potential Seawatts customers,
            resellers, or investors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement is governed by New
            York law without reference to its conflict of laws principles. The
            United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
            Goods will not apply to this Agreement. Subject to Section 11, all
            claims arising under this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in
            the federal or state courts in New York, New York. The parties
            submit to the jurisdiction in those courts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. Injunctive Relief.</strong> If either party breaches
            Sections 3.A (Use Restrictions), 4 (Intellectual Property and Data)
            or 5 (Confidentiality), the other party may suffer irreparable harm,
            and monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate the
            non-breaching party. Accordingly, either party may, in addition to
            any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, seek
            injunctive or other equitable relief in response to any such breach.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. Further Assurances.</strong> Each party will execute and
            deliver any documents or instruments, and take any further actions
            that are reasonably required, to provide the other party the full
            benefits and rights described in this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. Attorneys’ Fees.</strong> In any action or proceeding to
            enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be
            entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>F. Assignment.</strong> Customer may not assign this
            Agreement or delegate its performance without Seawatts’s prior
            written consent, and any attempt to do so is void. Seawatts may
            assign this Agreement or delegate its performance without Customer’s
            consent. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of
            the parties’ permitted successors and assigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>G. Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement
            or portion of a provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the
            rest of this Agreement will remain in effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>H. No Waiver.</strong> Neither party will be treated as
            having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise
            of) any rights under this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I. Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement (including the
            Privacy Policy and any Orders) constitutes the entire agreement and
            supersedes any other agreement of the parties relating to its
            subject matter (including any nondisclosure agreements entered into
            in anticipation of this Agreement). Any additional provisions
            (including any “click wrap” terms, terms referenced via URL, or
            otherwise) in any purchase order or other document provided by
            Customer will be void and have no binding effect on Seawatts. No
            usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing
            between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, or supplement
            the terms of the Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>J. Amendment.</strong> This Agreement may only be amended in
            a writing signed by both parties and stating that it is amending
            this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>K. Relationship.</strong> The parties are independent
            contractors of each other. Each party is responsible for instructing
            and managing its employees and personnel. This Agreement does not
            create any agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship
            between the parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>L. No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> There are no
            third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M. Notices.</strong> All notices under this Agreement must
            be in writing, and will be considered given: (1) upon delivery, if
            delivered personally or by internationally recognized courier
            service; (2) three business days after being sent, if delivered by
            U.S. registered or certified mail (return receipt requested); or (3)
            upon acknowledgement of receipt, if delivered by email. Either party
            may update its notice address by notice to the other party in
            accordance with this Section 12.M. All notices to Seawatts will be
            sent to:
          </p>
          <p>Seawatts, LLC.</p>
          <p>2048 N 78th St, Seattle,</p>
          <p>WA 98103</p>
          <p>Email: chris.watts.t@gmail.com</p>
          <p>Attn: Legal</p>
          <p>
            <strong>N. Force Majeure.</strong> Seawatts will not be liable for
            any delay or failure to perform under this Agreement as a result of
            any cause or condition beyond Seawatts’s reasonable control (a
            “Force Majeure Event”), so long as Seawatts uses reasonable efforts
            to avoid or remove those causes of delay or non-performance. If a
            Force Majeure Event causes Seawatts to delay or fail to perform its
            obligations under this Agreement for 30 consecutive days, either
            party may terminate this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>O. Interpretation.</strong> If Seawatts provides a
            translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the
            translation is provided solely for convenience, and the English
            version will prevail. Any heading, caption, or section title
            contained in this Agreement is for convenience only, and in no way
            defines or explains any section or provision. Any use of the term
            “including” or variations thereof in this Agreement will be
            construed as if followed by the phrase “without limitation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>P. Counterparts.</strong> This Agreement may be executed in
            counterparts (which may be exchanged by email). Each counterpart
            should be considered an original, but all counterparts together
            should constitute the same Agreement.
