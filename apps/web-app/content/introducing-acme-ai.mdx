We're thrilled to unveil **Untrace**, the middleware platform that's transforming how AI teams handle LLM observability. Say goodbye to vendor lock-in and integration nightmares. üöÄ

## The Problem We're Solving

In today's AI landscape, teams face critical observability challenges:

- Managing multiple observability platform integrations
- High switching costs between vendors
- Fragmented trace data across different tools
- Exploding monitoring costs without control

When we surveyed 200 AI teams, 67% cited observability tool sprawl as their biggest operational pain point. Teams are spending more time managing integrations than improving their AI systems.

## Our Solution

1. **Single Integration**: Replace multiple SDKs with one unified interface
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Send traces to the right platform based on your rules
3. **Cost Optimization**: Sample intelligently and route based on value
4. **Zero Lock-in**: Switch platforms without changing a line of code

## Core Features

- **Universal Trace Capture**: OpenAI-compatible proxy, native SDKs, or webhooks
- **Smart Routing Rules**: Route by model, cost, errors, or custom metadata
- **10+ Integrations**: LangSmith, Langfuse, Keywords.ai, and more
- **<50ms Latency**: Enterprise-grade performance at scale
- **PII Protection**: Automatic detection and redaction
- **99.95% Uptime**: Reliable delivery with automatic failover

## Why Untrace Stands Out

> "Untrace saved us from observability hell. We went from maintaining 4 different integrations to just one, and our monitoring costs dropped by 60%." - Dana Chen, Engineering Manager at Untrace Corp

Our platform isn't just another tool; it's your observability infrastructure layer. Here's how we compare:

| Feature                  | Direct Integration | Untrace |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------- |
| Setup Time              | 3 weeks            | 30 mins |
| Platform Flexibility    | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ      |
| Cost Control            | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ      |
| Unified Analytics       | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ      |
